**Nairobi women in data science and machine learning (NWiMLDS)** is one of the global chapters under Women in Machine Learning and Data Science [(WiMLDS)](http://wimlds.org/) a non-profit 501(c)(3) based in New York.

We aim to support and promote informal meetups, study groups and to discuss machine learning and data science in an informal setting with the purpose of building a community around women and gender minorities who are interested in the fields of machine learning and data science.
